## What is this?

This is a repository for my personal Hackintosh EFIs.

Made with OpenCore (at least version 1), and it wasn't made with OpCore Simpify*, distros, or configurators (OCC, OCAT).

## Can I use it?

Sure, but I am not advertising this as a prebuilt EFIs. I am also not accepting support requests about my EFIs. It's my EFIs, not your EFIs.

## Machines Included (1)

- HP Notebook BY-1022cl
    - Drive removed (so it now boots off of an external USB drive)
    - Different WiFi chipset (undecided, but most likely an AX201)
